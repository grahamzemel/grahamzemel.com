# Graham Zemel (.com) v1.0
Created by [Graham Zemel](https://github.com/gzemel/)

## Basic Info
-This is not the extent of my front-end design knowledge, I used a few newer libraries and this site was mostly an experiment.  
-It was a ton of fun to code, and I highly recommend learning a bit of front-end if you're mainly a back-end web dev or not even a web developer at all.  
-If anyone would like to contribute and re-code it better I'm open to suggestions, and encourage them.   

**-Any developers are more than welcome to use the code from this repo in their own programs and apps, however the copyright in the sidebar must be included. Thanks!**
