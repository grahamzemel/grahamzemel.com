I created multiple scripts for physical pen-testing using my Bash Bunny, a hotplug attack tool.

The bash bunny is one of the most powerful physical attack vectors that I know of, running quick payloads and having tons of futuristic-type capabilities. Things like bluetooth low energy allow it to execute payloads upon a proximity trigger, and it even has multiple payload switches for modifications on the go.

The amount of development and contributions on this project are insane, check out the [main github repository](https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads) and you'll find hundreds of payloads. [My Github repository](https://github.com/gzemel/Hotplug_Attacks) has a few that I've found are the most effective with things like admin access and anti-virus evasion. 

I'll be developing more for that repository in the coming months, but I highly suggest picking up a [Bash Bunny (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3MuNC7Z) anyways if you know a little bit of coding and trying to make some scripts yourself.
