I created multiple scripts for physical pen-testing using my Bash Bunny, a hotplug attack tool. The bash bunny is one of the most powerful physical attack vectors that I've ever used, running quick payloads and utilizing tons of futuristic-type capabilities. 

Things like bluetooth low energy allow it to execute payloads upon a proximity trigger, and it even has multiple payload switches for modifications on the go.

The amount of development and contributions on this project is really something, check out the <Link href='https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads'>main github repository</Link> and you'll find hundreds of payloads. <Link href='https://github.com/grahamzemel/Hotplug_Attacks'>My Github repository</Link> has a few that I've found are the most effective with things like admin access and anti-virus evasion. 

I'll be developing more for that repository in the coming months, but I highly suggest picking up a <Link href='https://amzn.to/3MuNC7Z'>Bash Bunny</Link> anyways if you know a little bit of coding and trying to make some scripts yourself.
