This is a simple, barebones template repository that is intended for use with my post on <Link href='https://medium.com/the-gray-area/creating-a-personal-portfolio-website-an-in-depth-guide-for-beginners-7155a785bfb3'>creating your own portfolio website</Link> .

This was a really fun post to write because I tried to make it as detailed as possible, that way anyone could follow it. Even if you weren't a programmer and wanted to host achievements of some sort or cool videos.  

I found the easiest way to get a website with your name on it (like <strong>grahamzemel.com</strong>) was going to <Link href='https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1GRAHAM51'>Hostinger</Link> and purchasing a decent package, and then upload your own files to it as a portfolio type site.

If you'd like to make your website look nice and polished, or even just upload some template code, for beginners I suggest going over to <Link href='https://github.com/grahamzemel'>Github</Link> and searching for some neat portfolio website templates. Or, you're welcome to use <strong>this</strong> website and modify it, just be sure to give credit if you do and leave the copyright in the sidebar. 

If you're a moderately-skilled or <strong>advanced</strong> developer, I suggest coding a site yourself (yes, it's a lot of work but worth it), or go to <Link href='https://awwwards.com'>Awwwards.com</Link> for some inspiration.
