<p>
  <strong>Student Living Advocacy Group</strong> is a student-run reporting hub for off-campus housing on the Hill in Boulder.
  It creates a shared record of real living conditions and resident experiences—so patterns are visible, not isolated.
</p>

<p><strong>What it enables</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience logging</strong>: document issues, conditions, and outcomes in a consistent format.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregation for advocacy</strong>: roll up reports to support requests for repairs, accountability, and change.</li>
  <li><strong>Neighborhood focus</strong>: centered specifically on Hill-area off-campus housing.</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted" style="margin-top:.5rem;">
  The goal is simple: make student housing realities easier to document, understand, and improve.
