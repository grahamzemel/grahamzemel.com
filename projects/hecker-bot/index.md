This telegram bot that I coded from scratch takes in numerous types of commands automates hacking processes that would otherwise take considerably longer. 

I've recently updated it to work in more states, and if you'd like to give it a try check it out [here](https://t.me/heckerbot2022bot). I'll start adding reverse-address capabilities and other features in the coming weeks. Feel free to [contact me](/contact) and suggest features too, I'm always open to improvements.

The source code is really interesting to look at, however some of the services don't want a lot of traffic so I can't publicly disclose it. For a select few willing to contribute, it's available on [gumroad](https://grahamzemel.gumroad.com/l/HackerBot).

I used a few different services for hosting and such, and it's one of my favorite projects. If you're into cybersecurity, I recommend purchasing access to the source code and seeing what you can add.
