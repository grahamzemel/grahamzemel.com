This telegram bot that I coded from scratch automates hacking processes for bug hunting and general cybersecurity purposes. 

Right now, it's main functionality is obtaining the address and owners of a house with <strong>just a last name and town</strong>. 

I've recently updated it to work in more states, and if you'd like to give it a try check it out <Link href='https://t.me/heckerbot2022bot'>here</Link> . I'll start adding <strong>reverse-address capabilities</strong> and other features in the coming weeks. Feel free to <Link href='/contact'>contact me</Link> and suggest features too, I'm always open to improvements.

The source code is really interesting to look at, however some of the services don't want a lot of traffic so I can't publicly disclose it. For a select few willing to contribute, you can purchase it here:

I used a couple different services for hosting and such, and it's one of my favorite projects. If you're into cybersecurity, I recommend purchasing access to the source code and seeing what you can add.
