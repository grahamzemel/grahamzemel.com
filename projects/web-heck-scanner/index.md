A hacking tool built for the bug hunters, Web Heck Scanner is a compilation of 3 popular hacking tools and 5 components that hands you bugs on a silver platter.

This was <strong>one of my favorite tools</strong> to build, and I learned a bunch of Bash while creating it. It's got tools like sqlmap, Nuclei, Nikto, and much more.
