An automated calculator Google Extension built to automatically calculate <strong>both weighted and unweighted GPAs</strong> of students through the powerschool.org gradebook. It's available on the <Link href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/powerschool-gpa-calculato/dgfnbmfhjioifionnlcklnpfkkjjglbj?hl=en&authuser=0'>Chrome Web Store</Link> .

This was a fun project to build, and I learned a lot about how to build Google Extensions. It's fairly simple to use, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
