Coded with frameworks and tools such as <Link href='https://svelte.dev/'>Svelte</Link> , <Link href='https://tailwindcss.com/grahamzemel/CreateCryptoToken'>Tailwind</Link> , and <Link href='https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/'>Mdsvex</Link> for markdown files. It's domain (grahamzemel.com) is provided by <Link href='https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1GRAHAM51'>Hostinger</Link> .

This website took way too long to make, as I hadn't used some of these front-end libraries before and was still experimenting. 

It's not the way I wanted it to look for the most part and if I took more time I could have achieved a better feel, but I learned a lot and that's what matters to me.

If you'd like to check out the repository, it's linked at the bottom of this project or in the source code <Link href='https://github.com/grahamzemel/grahamzemel.com'>here</Link> .

If you fork or modify the code, make sure to keep the copyright in the sidebar and I'd appreciate a reference in the contributions.
