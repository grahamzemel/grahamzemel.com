This website, that I coded from scratch using tools such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) for markdown files. It's domain (my name) is provided using [Hostinger (affiliate link)](https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1GRAHAM51).

This website took way too long to make, as I hadn't used some of these front-end libraries before and was still experimenting. 

It's not the way I wanted it to look for the most part and if I took more time I could have achieved a better feel, but I learned a lot and that's what matters to me.
